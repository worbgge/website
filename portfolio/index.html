        <h2 id=website>Creating a website</h2>
        <h3>Server Side</h3>
        <p>I've created many websites (this one included) where I have a deep knowledge of not just HTML, CSS, and JS but also the networking that also goes behind creating a website.</p>
        <script src="https://asciinema.org/a/gVynUaPhJHtHVKS7KFaLsdIKa.js"id="asciicast-gVynUaPhJHtHVKS7KFaLsdIKa"async="true"data-rows="20"></script>
        <p class="small"><a href=https://asciinema.org/a/gVynUaPhJHtHVKS7KFaLsdIKa>Video link</a></p>
        <p>In this demo I show the networking side of creating a website.</p>
        <p>First I installed nginx, which is a web server, which is the software that will be used to run my website.</p>
        <p>Second, I start to configure nginx so that it sees where my files are being held and what ports to listen on (here, I put 80, which is the port for HTTP - later I will go through how to add HTTPS or port 443).</p>
        <p>After configuring where to find the files for my website, I then create the website. For this tutorial I created a very simple .html file with no CSS (I extended on this further later to create this page).</p>
            <p>After creating the HTML file and in turn creating the website, I used the command `ln -s`, which is a symbolic link that will link the two files as if they were the same file. I linked the file from sites-available to sites-enabled, which now means that the website can now be seen on our web browser.</p>
        <p>But before opening the server, I must open the `80` and `443` ports, as these ports will be used to access the website. With those open, I can type localhost:80 to see the website.</p>
        <img src=/f/website_image.png alt="website preview">
        <p>Lastly, now that we have an HTTP server, we can enable HTTPS for the web server.</p>
        <p>First we install certbot. I installed certbot-nginx and ran the command certbot --nginx.</p>
        <img src=/f/certbot.png alt="certbot process">
        <p>Now that certbot has run, it will run out once every year. Additionally, we can create a cron job that will run every year to update this certbot.</p>
        <pre class="code-block"><code>0 0 1 1 * certbot --nginx renew</code></pre>
        <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>This section is a lot less server focused and a lot more focused on making a website look good.</p>
        <script src="https://asciinema.org/a/gVynUaPhJHtHVKS7KFaLsdIKa.js"id="asciicast-dvvI7mzJKenZyfNI37lWnLyBn"async="true"data-rows="20"></script>
        <p class="small"><a href=https://asciinema.org/a/dvvI7mzJKenZyfNI37lWnLyBn>Video link</a></p>
        <p>We start the website with DOCTYPE; this just tells the browser what it should be expecting (in this case, HTML). After the doctype, you have the HTML header, and in this header we give the attribute "xmlns" which makes it conform with XHTML; we also sent the language here.</p>
        <p>Next is the head tag, which does lots of different things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Title: Gives the title for the page, which will show in the browser tab.</li>
            <li>Charset: Specifies the character encoding for HTML.</li>
            <li>Stylesheet: Rel is required to specify the relationship with this document and another document (in this case, style.css).</li>
            <li>Viewport: This is an accessibility change that makes mobile use of the website look better.</li>
            <li>Author: This isn't required, but is useful to get the contact information of the author/</li>
            <li>Icon: Gives the icon, which will be used in the tab.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After the head tag (and has been closed off with /head), we get to the body tag, which shows everything that will be within the document.</p>
        <p>We start with the pre tag, which is similar to p but for preformatted text. Here I copy in some output I get from a terminal command "neofetch" with a modified version more fit for this website.</p>
        <p>After closing off the pre, we go on to the last two parts of the HTML document, that being both p tags to show my email address (something which is important to put on a website) and some small text that shows the last time the page was edited.</p>
        <p>Now after finishing the HTML document, I go back and go to the style.css, which was defined earlier.</p>
        <p>In the CSS file we first define what HTML tag we are editing, so first is body, which we give the background of #282828 and the colour of #f6e187; background defines the background colour of the element and color defines the text colour of the element.</p>
        <p>Now that body has been set we go with two smaller ones which are `a` and `.small`; `a` is a built-in html element so we can just give that a colour meanwhile .small isn't, the `.` indicates that this is a class instead of a built-in element and we give this the `font-size:small` argument to give every tag that uses the .small class be given the small font.</p>
        <p>The colours that were used go in line with the gruvbox colour scheme, which I think personally is the best theme that has multiple iterations of it. Now that the HTML and CSS have been written, we can see how the website looks.</p>

        <h2 id=mail>Email Server</h2>
        <p>Since creating a web server, I can now create a mail server, which will allow me to send and receive mail.</p>
        <script src="https://asciinema.org/a/J0kgLWYLp82bZ9M6DKCS8BaL7.js" id="asciicast-J0kgLWYLp82bZ9M6DKCS8BaL7" async="true"data-rows="20"></script>
        <p class="small"><a href=https://asciinema.org/a/J0kgLWYLp82bZ9M6DKCS8BaL7>Video link</a></p>
        <p>Here is an example of me sending my own mail address (me@worbgge.xyz) some mail using the netcat command. I put the mail address in mail.worbgge.xyz at port 25 (TCP) and can now send an email.</p>
        <img src="/f/email.png" alt="email received">
        <p>This is the email I received from the command, and it shows that my email is working fine, so I can host my own email server, which I have been doing for the last 2 years.</p>
        <h2 id=wifi>WIFI Hacking</h2>
        <p>During my time at university (2023-2024), I created a Wi-Fi hacking tutorial using a MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attack. Using the software fluxion, I described what you had to do to set up a man-in-the-middle attack.</p>
        <img src=/f/fluxion.png alt="fluxion">
        <p>How fluxion worked was like this: it created a copy of the network you wanted to connect to (so, for example, BTHUB6-53CZ), and when you logged into the copied version, it asked for your password and then gave you internet however, because of how the internet worked, I took the password for the internet and can now log in to the non-spoofed address.</p>
        <img src=/f/different_networks.png alt="networks">
        <p></p>
        <img src=/f/selection_network_screen.png alt="networks">
        <p>Now that a person has connected to the network, it will save the information about that connection. At university I got a 84 out of 100 marks for this (and some other stuff).</p>
        <img src=/f/networks_selection.png alt="networks">
        <p></p>
        <img src=/f/network_results.png alt="networks">
        <p class="small">All networking hacking was done on my own network without any illegal activity taking place.</p>
        <h2 id=osint>OSINT</h2>
        <p>Another project that I did in university, although not tied to an assignment, was something just fun to do with an OSINT challenge where we were tasked with trying to get as much information about one of our tutors as possible that was on the internet.</p>
        <p>We were left this information to find out about our tutor:</p>

        </ul>
        <p>After these we were also tasked to find where some images had been taken.</p>
        <p>To view the document, see <a href="/f/OSINT_investigation.pdf">here.</a></p>
        <p>After being given this brief, I started to work by myself on tracking down all the information and working on the images, and in the end, I came in 3rd place, only behind a team of people and someone who got the bonus 500 points.</p>
